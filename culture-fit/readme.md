# Culture Fit

Below are written questions that we'd like you to answer. You can be direct and to the point. We're hiring a programmer not a writer, so there's no need to opine on the human condition, unless you think it illustrates your point!

There are no right answers, we're just trying to get a sense of how you think and operate.

You can write your answers in this file below these headings.

## Describe a time when you faced a difficult tradeoff. What steps did you take to come to your decision?

## Tell us about a time when your product vision diverged from a co-worker. How did you handle it? How did they? What was the resolution?

## Most people don't realize this, but software engineering is just like _______! [Elaborate]

## We all have cognative bias. Its basically judgement cacheing. But, just like caching, it can really get in the way. What's a time you had to confront your biases?

## How are you most effectively managed?
