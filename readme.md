# Fraight Technical Assessment

Dear Applicant,

We're excited you're interested in working at Fraight. You and I are engaged in one of the most difficult human tasks. Picking a software engineer--or in your case, picking a company--is the task of match making. It's impossible to find a precise formula for building a cohesive, happy team. The stakes are also high. Getting a job you don't like is as expensive for you as a mismatched hire is for us.

With this in mind, we want to commit to you the following values:
- Thoroughness. We're going to ask the tough questions--just as we expect you to!
- Respectful of you and your time. We know how time-consuming a job search can be. We will do whatever possible to get back to you quickly at every stage, not put you through pointless hoops.
- Candid. We'll be honest with you at every stage.

The application process consists of 3 steps.

- Initial conversation 
- Technical & cultural screening
- Onsite

This repo serves contains the screening materials. There are two sections, `culture-fit` and `paginated-kittens`. If you have any questions about either, don't hesitate to ask. It's never our intention to ask trick questions, or leave out required information.

Please clone this repo. When you're done, push up your solutions to your own repo. We ask that you do not fork. If you'd like the repo to be private, or to email us a zip, that's fine. When you're done, let us know by emailing parker@fraight.com and zeke+assessment@fraight.com

Thank you for your interest in Fraight!

Zeke Nierenberg
CTO
