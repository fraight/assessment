# Fraight Technical Assessment

Dear Applicant,

You and I are engaged in one of the most difficult human tasks. Picking a software engineer--or in your case, picking a company--is the task of match making. Its impossible to find a precise formula for building a cohesive, happy team. The stakes are also high. Getting a job you don't like is as expensive for you as a mismatched hire is for us.

With this in mind, we want to commit to you the following values:
- Thoroughness. We're going to ask the tough questions--just as we expect you to!
- Respectful of you and your time. We know how time-consuming a job search can be. We will do whatever possible to get back to you quickly at every stage, not put you through pointless hoops.
- Candid. We'll be honest with you at every stage.

The application process consists of 3 steps.

- Initial conversation with me
- Technical & cultural screening
- Onsite

This repo serves contains the screening materials. There are two sections, `culture-fit` and `paginated-kittens`. If you have any questions about either, don't hesitate to ask. It's never our intention to ask trick questions, or leave out required information.

Thank you for your interest in Fraight!

- Zeke Nierenberg
